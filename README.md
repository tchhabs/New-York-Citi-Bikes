### Gender Analysis

The data we are looking at are sample sizes from 2017 and 2018. Based on the first dashboard, males appear to use the citi bikes more often in New York than females, but as one would assume, the number of trips by both genders decrease during the colder months. Using the line graphs, you can see that the most number of trips are in October of 2017 and 2018, we went a little more in depth, and saw that October 7th and 8th also have the longest trip durations by males and females. It is also interesting to see that the trip durations are higher for females, averaging about 18 minutes and 14 minutes for males. Anoter metric is the user type, there are customers (24 hour pass or 3 days pass) and subscribers (annual member), females account for more customers and subscribers than males. It looks like it is safe to say that the Citi Bikes are more popular with women than males in New Your City.
